Medi Trace
Medi Trace is a Flutter application designed for veterinary doctors when they visit cattle farms. The app allows veterinarians to scan an animal's ear tag and the QR codes on medicines. With just one click, the scanned data—including the ear tag number and the associated medicine—is saved in the backend database for easy record-keeping and management.
